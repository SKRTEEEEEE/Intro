      resum:
        'Smart contacts are an emerging technology that allows users to control electronic devices and perform online activities through direct eye interaction. However, concerns over the environmental impact of these devices remain an important issue. One way to reduce pollution from smart contacts is through the optimization of computational costs.',

        'Smart contacts are an emerging technology that can help reduce pollution in companies. This is because these devices can optimize the use of resources such as materials and energy by minimizing unnecessary processes. One of the ways that smart contacts can reduce pollution is by monitoring and controlling production processes. By interacting directly with the eyes of workers, smart contacts can detect and report inefficiencies in production processes, allowing companies to reduce the amount of material and energy used. In addition, smart contacts can help companies optimize their energy use. For example, by directly interacting with lighting systems, smart contacts can adjust light intensity based on the amount of natural light available. This not only reduces energy consumption, but can also improve the working environment.',

      summary:
        'The use of smart contracts can help drive sustainable energy initiatives',
      resum:
        'Smart contracts are an innovative technology that uses blockchain to automate contract execution. These contracts are self-executing and provide a secure and transparent method for enforcing agreements. In the energy sector, smart contracts can be used to promote sustainable energy initiatives by reducing the need for intermediaries, enabling peer-to-peer energy trading, and facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources.',

        'Smart contracts are an innovative technology that can help promote sustainable energy initiatives. By using blockchain technology, smart contracts can provide a secure and transparent method for enforcing agreements in the energy sector. For example, smart contracts can enable peer-to-peer energy trading by eliminating the need for intermediaries, making it easier for consumers to buy and sell energy. Additionally, smart contracts can facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources by automating the process of verifying the source of the energy and ensuring that it is used to power the correct devices. With the potential to revolutionize the energy industry, smart contracts represent a significant step forward in the quest for sustainable energy.',
